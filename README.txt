Verify your download to ensure file integrity.
Open Windows PowerShell in the same folder and run:

cd "C:\Users\YOURPCNAME\Desktop\ZeroClassicChat"
After that the follow command: Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 ZeroClassicChat.exe

Open now ZeroClassicChat_v0.5.exe.hash as text,
And compare the displayed hash with the value inside

If they match, your file is mostly authentic original.
Always be carefull that you have download it from the right source!

‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Defender / Antivirus Warning

Why is Windows Defender blocking this file?
Since ZeroClassicChat is a new, unsigned application and not widely distributed yet, Windows Defender (and sometimes other antivirus tools) may flag it as suspicious by default.
This is known as a false positive and is common for independent or niche software without a verified publisher signature.

‚úÖ What you can do:

If you downloaded from the official source, and the SHA-256 hash matches.
You may need to click ‚ÄúMore info‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúRun anyway‚Äù when Windows Defender shows a warning.
You can also temporarily whitelist the file in your antivirus settings if needed.

üîê Tip for safety:
Always verify the file's integrity with the included .hash file before running the app. See the Verification section above for details.
