# ZeroClassicChat
A fully decentralized, public and private messaging app built on the Zero Classic blockchain. Encrypted communication owned and controlled by no one but you.

üìò <b>Overview</b>

ZeroClassicChat communicates directly through the ZeroClassic full node that runs all local on you computer.
It uses the ZeroClassic peer-to-peer blockchain network with no central servers or third-party services.
As long as your full node is running, the chat can send coins and exchange messages across the whole network.
